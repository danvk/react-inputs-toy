# react-inputs-toy
A toy demonstration of uncontrolled inputs in React.js.

This creates two synchronized inputs:

1. The slider is [controlled][]. Dragging it results in immediate updates.
2. The text box is uncontrolled. This allows typing in the text box without
   updating the UI until desired.

Check out [app.js][] to see how it works.
